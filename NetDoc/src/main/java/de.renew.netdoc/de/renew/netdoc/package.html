<p>NetDoc IFA drawing documentation plugin for Renew.</p>

<p>This plugin provides a framework to create and edit IFA drawing
documentations. By default the documentation is saved in a separate file using
the same name and path as the corresponding drawing. Only the filename
extension (e.g. <code>.rnw</code>) is exchanged by <code>.doctex</code>.</p>

<p>This plugin also provides a GUI that attaches to the Renew GUI providing a
window-based solution to edit the documentations.</p>
